# Web Usage Time Tracker

A simple web-based time tracker that lets you monitor how long you spend on any website. Open a URL in a new tab, start tracking, and stop when done — your session time is saved and visualized with a chart.

## Features

- Enter any website URL and give your session a custom name.
- Start and stop tracking sessions manually.
- Live timer displayed during active tracking.
- Session history saved locally in browser using `localStorage`.
- Interactive bar chart summarizing total time spent per session.
- Dark mode toggle for comfortable viewing.
- Session log with clickable URLs and timestamps.
- Reset all stored data with a single button.
- Responsive and easy to use interface.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Enter a session name (e.g., "YouTube", "Study", "Work").
3. Enter the URL you want to track (e.g., `https://www.youtube.com`).
4. Click **Start Tracking** — the site opens in a new tab and the timer starts.
5. When finished, return to the tracker page and click **Stop Tracking**.
6. Your session is saved and displayed in the session log and chart.
7. Use **Reset All** to clear all saved data.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Future Improvements
